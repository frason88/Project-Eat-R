## What's next for EatAR
While executing the idea for this project, we looked into how we could improve our mobile application. The limitation of the current version is that the restaurant owners may have to recruit a 3D artist or be proficient in Unity to have a 3D model of their dish, so we thought about creating an API between the application with a photogrammetry software. This would allow the restaurant owners to instantly create 3D models of their dish by just photographing it in different angles. To also ensure that the 3D model quality is equal for every restaurant, we also read about ML models that can drastically enhance photo quality.
